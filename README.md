# NNI - An Automatic Neural Network Intelligence Toolkit

[Neural Network Intelligence (NNI)](https://github.com/microsoft/nni) is a python AutoML package that works on Linux and Windows. This package trains neural networks models and finds a tuple of hyper-parameters that yields an optimal model. Moreover, it enables to conduct researches and experiments fast, effectively and without too much efforts. 
This package provides also a web interface that helps users investigating their trials and explore the experiment results.
